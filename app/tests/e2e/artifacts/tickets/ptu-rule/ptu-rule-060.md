## Summary

No PTU level-budget encounter creation formula or significance multiplier. PTU uses level*2*players budget for encounter difficulty and x1-x5 significance for XP scaling. The app uses a density-based spawn system instead.

## Expected Behavior (PTU Rules)

Encounter difficulty is determined by total level budget (sum of opponent levels vs. player level * 2 * party size). Significance multiplier (x1-x5) scales XP rewards.

## Actual Behavior

The density tier system controls spawn count but has no connection to level-based budgeting or significance-based XP scaling.
