Soak is stored in [[movedata-reference-table]] with `damageClass: "Status"`, `type: "Water"`, `damageBase: null`, `frequency: "Daily"`, `ac: 2`, `range: "5, 1 Target"`.

## Frequency

Daily frequency is enforced by the [[move-frequency-system]]. `checkMoveFrequency` checks both the `usedToday` counter (limit of 1) and the per-scene cap — daily moves can only be used [[daily-moves-once-per-scene|once per scene]] regardless of remaining daily uses. Daily uses refresh on [[extended-rest|extended rest]].

## Resolution

As a Status move, Soak skips the [[damage-flow-pipeline]]. An accuracy roll against AC 2 is required via the [[evasion-and-accuracy-system]].

## Ability Interactions

No ability-interaction flags are set in the [[moves-csv-source-file]].
