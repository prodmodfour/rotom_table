# App Surface Map

Testable features, routes, and API endpoints for the PTU Session Helper.

## Dev Server

### Player View (`/player`) — Individual player interface

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/player` | Character picker, character sheet, Pokemon team, encounter with combat actions, scene view |

**Key player components:** `PlayerIdentityPicker.vue` (character selection overlay), `PlayerNavBar.vue` (bottom tab navigation — Character/Team/Encounter/Scene), `PlayerCharacterSheet.vue` (read-only stats, skills, features, equipment, inventory), `PlayerPokemonTeam.vue` + `PlayerPokemonCard.vue` + `PlayerMoveList.vue` (team display), `PlayerEncounterView.vue` (encounter state with combatant cards by side), `PlayerCombatantInfo.vue` (visibility-aware combatant display — exact HP for own, percentage for enemies), `PlayerCombatActions.vue` (full PTU combat action panel — moves, shift, struggle, pass, item/switch/maneuver requests), `PlayerSceneView.vue` (read-only scene display with characters, pokemon, groups, weather), `PlayerSkeleton.vue` (skeleton loading screen shown while character data loads).

**Key player composables:** `usePlayerIdentity.ts` (localStorage persistence, character data fetching), `usePlayerCombat.ts` (turn detection, action execution, move availability, target helpers, league battle phase awareness, canBeCommanded check, WebSocket send via provide/inject), `useCharacterExportImport.ts` (JSON export download, import file upload with conflict detection feedback), `usePlayerWebSocket.ts` (single WebSocket connection owner for player page — scene sync, character updates, action ack routing, auto-identification on connect/reconnect), `usePlayerScene.ts` (player scene state — receives scene_sync via WS, REST fallback via fetchActiveScene, maps to PlayerSceneData), `useHapticFeedback.ts` (haptic feedback for touch interactions — vibration API wrapper for mobile devices).

**Player API endpoints:** `POST /api/player/action-request` (REST fallback for player action requests when WS is disconnected — registers in shared pendingRequests map, forwards to GM peers).

**Player WebSocket events:** `keepalive` / `keepalive_ack` (45s interval to prevent tunnel idle timeout), `scene_sync` (full scene data pushed to player on connect), `scene_request` (player requests current active scene), `player_action` (player submits action to GM), `player_action_ack` (GM acknowledges action — routed via pendingRequests map), `player_turn_notify` (P1 — turn notification), `player_move_request` / `player_move_response` (P1 — token movement), `group_view_request` / `group_view_response` (P1 — tab change requests).

- `POST /api/encounter-tables/:id/entries` — add entry
- `PUT/DELETE /api/encounter-tables/:id/entries/:entryId` — update, remove
- Sub-habitats: `GET/POST /api/encounter-tables/:id/modifications`, nested entries

### Scenes (`/api/scenes`)
Full CRUD + activate/deactivate + nested entities.
- `GET/POST /api/scenes` — list, create
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/scenes/:id` — read, update, delete
- `GET /api/scenes/active` — active scene
- `POST /api/scenes/:id/activate` — serve to Group View
- `POST /api/scenes/:id/deactivate` — unserve

- `POST/DELETE /api/scenes/:id/pokemon/:pokemonId` — add/remove Pokemon
- `POST /api/scenes/:id/groups` — create group
- `PUT/DELETE /api/scenes/:id/groups/:groupId` — update/delete group
- `PUT /api/scenes/:id/positions` — batch update positions

### Damage Calculation (`/api/encounters/:id/calculate-damage`)
Read-only combat math endpoint.
- `POST /api/encounters/:id/calculate-damage` — compute full PTU 9-step damage formula (STAB, type effectiveness, stages, crit) with detailed breakdown. Also computes dynamic evasion (physical, special, speed) from stage-modified stats and accuracy threshold. Does not modify encounter state.

### Capture (`/api/capture`)
Action-only. Both endpoints accept optional `ballType` parameter (key in POKE_BALL_CATALOG, default: `'Basic Ball'`).
- `POST /api/capture/rate` — calculate capture rate with ball modifier breakdown
- `POST /api/capture/attempt` — execute capture with ball modifier applied to roll; server validates AC 6 gate when `accuracyRoll` is provided (rejects with 400 on miss)

**Accuracy gate (PTU p.214):** Poke Ball throws are AC 6 Status Attack Rolls. `rollAccuracyCheck()` returns `{ roll, isNat1, isNat20, hits, total }`. Natural 1 always misses, natural 20 always hits, otherwise roll >= 6 required. On miss, the Standard Action is consumed but no capture attempt occurs. Both `handleApproveCapture` (GM-side) and `attempt.post.ts` (server-side) enforce this gate. The ack to the player includes `accuracyHit: boolean` so the UI can distinguish misses from capture failures.

**Poke Ball system (feature-017):** `constants/pokeBalls.ts` (POKE_BALL_CATALOG — 25 PTU ball types with base modifiers, condition descriptions, post-capture effects; PokeBallDef interface, PokeBallCategory type, BallConditionContext interface, calculateBallModifier — returns base + conditional modifier breakdown, getBallsByCategory, getBallDef, getAvailableBallNames, DEFAULT_BALL_TYPE), `utils/pokeBallConditions.ts` (evaluateBallCondition — pure condition evaluator for 13 conditional balls: Timer/Quick/Level/Heavy/Fast/Love/Net/Dusk/Moon/Lure/Repeat/Nest/Dive; returns modifier + conditionMet + description), `server/services/ball-condition.service.ts` (buildConditionContext — auto-populates BallConditionContext from DB: encounter round, active Pokemon, species data, trainer ownership; shared by rate.post.ts and attempt.post.ts; checkEvolvesWithStone, deriveEvoLine — pure helpers), `composables/useCapture.ts` (getCaptureRate — accepts encounterId/trainerId for full server-side context, calculateCaptureRateLocal — accepts conditionContext for client-side ball condition preview, attemptCapture, getAvailableBalls, rollAccuracyCheck — all accept ballType parameter). `rate.post.ts` accepts optional `encounterId`/`trainerId` to auto-populate full ball condition context via the shared service.

### Group View State (`/api/group`)
Get/set/clear pattern.
- `GET/PUT /api/group/tab` — active tab state
- `GET/POST/DELETE /api/group/map` — served map
- `GET/POST/DELETE /api/group/wild-spawn` — wild spawn preview

- `GET /api/settings/tunnel` — get configured Cloudflare Tunnel URL
- `PUT /api/settings/tunnel` — set or clear Cloudflare Tunnel URL (Zod-validated)

### Utilities

- `POST /api/abilities/batch` — batch ability detail lookup from AbilityData (up to 50 names)

## Selector Guidance

Prefer `data-testid` attributes for Playwright selectors. The app does not currently have widespread `data-testid` usage — add them as needed when writing spec files, or fall back to:

1. `getByRole()` — buttons, links, headings
2. `getByLabel()` — form inputs
3. `getByText()` — visible text content
4. `.locator('css-selector')` — last resort
